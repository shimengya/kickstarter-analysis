# Kickstarting with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

The spreadsheet displays how theaters lunched with different funding goal over 2010 to 2017. Providing theater’s pledged funding compared to the goal or based on the date, the chart and the graph could be driven from the data which is more visitable.

### Purpose

The chart and graphs show the tendency and success percentage, it’s helpful for clients or firms who are interested in launching theaters per the analysis to better set up a funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Per the picture of Theater Outcomes by Launch Date, we could easily learn the tendency of successful, failed and canceled projects over months. In the meantime, the pivot table also provides figures if we want to know the exact numbers.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

It might be challenging to convert the right format as required. While google is always the best friend to ask. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  - Successful launched theater are more than the failed and canceled, almost doubling of total failed and canceled.
  - Successful lunched theater have a peak time in summer time especially in May which hit around 110%.
  - There is no theater canceled in October.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - Both the numbers of successfully and failed theater launched are largest between 1000 to 4999 and tend to decrease as goal increase.
  - The tendency of successfully launched theater percentage decrease once the goal of funding increase while the percentage of failed launched theater shows the opposite way.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - The formats of deadline and launched_at were wrong initially and not readable. I converted the format to date makes them easily readable.
  - It combined the category and subcategory into the same column which is not easily understanding.
  - it only provides the numbers without any average and percentage calculations. It difficult to understand how the goal and date impact on the results.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - we could use pie chart or bar chart.
